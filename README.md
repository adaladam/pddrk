This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

My wife was struggling with preparation for Traffic Laws Examination in order to get her
driver license. So I made this project for her :)

First this small web app contained just something about 2000 questions and
a tiny test engine. Once this app became famous among my wife's friends, she asked to add
a competition element. Which I did.

By using Firebase's database, I added multiuser test simulation :) Now my wife and her
friends could try their best and compete for higher scores.
